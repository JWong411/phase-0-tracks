# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? Version control: Lets you view the history of revisions to files, and merge revisions made by different people. Developers use it because it allows them to go back to a previous version of the program should a change break it.

* What is a branch and why would you use one? A branch gives you a sort of copy of your program/code to work on. Each branch can be worked on separately and then later merged.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? A commit is a save point in Git. A good commit message should be specific as to what exactly was done/changed.

* What is a merge conflict? A merge conflict occurs when you want to merge two branches where the same bit of code has been modified in separate ways.
